# 2D Array-Matrices
## Aim
We learn about 2D Arrays and matrix operations in C++.
## Theory
A 2D array in C++ is a structured collection of elements arranged in rows and columns, resembling a matrix in mathematics. It is declared using the syntax `data_type array_name[rows][columns];`. For instance, `int matrix[3][3];` creates a 3x3 integer matrix. Each element in a 2D array can be accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column, such as `matrix[1][2]` for the element in the second row and third column.

Matrix operations in C++ include common arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. For matrix addition and subtraction, corresponding elements from two matrices of the same dimensions are added or subtracted element-wise, resulting in a new matrix of the same size. For example, given two 3x3 matrices `A` and `B`, their sum `C` would be calculated as `C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]` using nested loops to iterate through rows and columns.

Matrix multiplication is more complex. It involves multiplying the elements of the rows of the first matrix by the corresponding elements of the columns of the second matrix and summing the products to form the elements of the resulting matrix. This operation requires that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. Efficient implementation of matrix operations is essential in various applications like graphics, scientific computations, and engineering simulations.
